# PPC Leads To Deals 
For the PPC Leads to Deals web platform, I was responsible for building the entire backend architecture using Laravel and MySQL. I developed robust API endpoints to manage property listings, user profiles, and premium subscription features. I also integrated a support ticket system, CRM functionality, and handled complex data such as property details, mortgage rates, and other real estate-specific attributes. My backend work ensured secure and efficient data management, allowing the React-based frontend to deliver a seamless user experience.
